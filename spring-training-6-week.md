### **Week 1: Introduction to Spring Framework and Spring Core**

**Objective**: Understand the Spring Framework and its core concepts.
**Theory**:
- What is the Spring Framework?
- Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
- Spring Core components: `ApplicationContext`, `BeanFactory`, and `@Bean`.
- Configuration: XML vs. Java-based configuration.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Set up a Spring project using Maven/Gradle.
- Create a simple Spring application with DI and IoC.
- Use `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` annotations.

**Assignment**:
- Build a simple application with multiple beans and demonstrate DI.

### **Week 2: Spring MVC Basics**
**Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of Spring MVC.
**Theory**:
- What is Spring MVC?
- MVC architecture: Model, View, Controller.
- Key components: `DispatcherServlet`, `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`.
- View technologies: JSP, Thymeleaf.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Create a Spring MVC project.
- Write a controller to handle requests and render views.
- Use `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, and `@ModelAttribute`.

**Assignment**:
- Build a simple web application with a form and display submitted data.
---
### **Week 3: Advanced Spring MVC**
**Objective**: Dive deeper into Spring MVC features.
**Theory**:
- Data binding and validation using `@Valid` and validation annotations.
- Exception handling with `@ExceptionHandler` and `@ControllerAdvice`.
- Interceptors (`HandlerInterceptor`) for pre/post-processing requests.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Add form validation to the application.
- Implement global exception handling.
- Create an interceptor to log request details.

**Assignment**:
- Enhance the Week 2 assignment with validation, exception handling, and logging.

### **Week 4: Introduction to Spring Boot**
**Objective**: Learn Spring Boot for rapid application development.
**Theory**:
- What is Spring Boot?
- Auto-configuration and starter dependencies.
- Creating RESTful APIs with `@RestController`.
- Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Create a Spring Boot project.
- Build a RESTful API for a simple resource (e.g., a to-do list).
- Use `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping`.

**Assignment**:
- Build a RESTful API for managing a collection of books (CRUD operations).

---
### **Week 5: Database Integration and Testing**
**Objective**: Integrate databases and write tests for Spring Boot applications.
**Theory**:
- Spring Data JPA for database integration.
- Entity mapping with `@Entity`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`.
- Writing unit tests with JUnit and Mockito.
- Testing REST APIs with `MockMvc`.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Connect the Spring Boot application to a database (e.g., H2, MySQL).
- Perform CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA.
- Write unit tests for controllers and services.

**Assignment**:
- Extend the Week 4 assignment to include database integration and unit tests.

---
### **Week 6: Deployment and Best Practices**
**Objective**: Deploy Spring Boot applications and follow best practices.
**Theory**:
- Packaging Spring Boot applications as JAR/WAR files.
- Deploying to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Best practices for Spring Boot development.
- Logging and monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator.

**Hands-On Practice**:
- Package the application as a JAR/WAR file.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform.
- Configure logging and monitoring.

---
### **Big Assignment: Build a Library Management System**

**Objective**: Apply all concepts learned to build a real-world application.
**Requirements**:
1. **User Management**:
    - Register and authenticate users.
2. **Book Management**:
    - Add, update, delete, and search books.
3. **Borrowing System**:
    - Allow users to borrow and return books.
4. **RESTful APIs**:
    - Expose APIs for all functionalities.
5. **Database Integration**:
    - Use Spring Data JPA to store data.
6. **Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for all services and controllers.
7. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy the application to a cloud platform.

**Weekly Breakdown**:

- **Week 1-2**: Set up the project, implement user management, and book catalog.
    
- **Week 3-4**: Add borrowing functionality and expose RESTful APIs.
    
- **Week 5**: Integrate the database and write unit tests.
    
- **Week 6**: Deploy the application and finalize documentation.
